Further work on imputation:

- wrangling the GitHub code used in Luken et al. 2021. Got this code to work with SciKitLearn's 'iris' dataset but realised that the Fermi-LAT dataset needed extensive reformatting.

- realised that in order to test the efficacy/accuracy of imputation I will need a working ML model to compare predictions with imputed values.

First time implementing ML on the Fermi-LAT dataset. This involved:

- finishing data processing: converting +/- infinite values to NaN (as they are not readable by scikitlearn algos), then removing all columns which contained more than 20% NaN values. This percentage may change in future.

- Removing all rows which still contained NaN values

- recoding CLASS1 column to be ML friendly. BCUs = 0 BLLs = 1 FSRQs = 2 and other objects = 4

- running the ANN algorithm MLPClassifier contained in the 'ML' Folder on ONLY known BLLs and FSRQs.

- some rough optimization of the algorithm by scaling values, changing the solver, changing the network size as well as increasing max allowable iterations. Currently 90% accurate. 

- In future will more rigorously optimize this algorithm to increase accuracy before using it to test the efficacy of imputation.
