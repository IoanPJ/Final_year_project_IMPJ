Final_year_project_IMPJ


This repository is organised into the following sections:

Data Processing: Intermediary steps and processing required to turn the Fermi-LAT .FIT file into a readable usable table that can be read by a machine learning model. This does NOT include any imputation steps.

Fermi-LAT Data: Contains raw and processed data files in a variety of formats.

Imputation: Contains the code required to add imputed values to the data set. 

ML: Contains the actual machine learning algorithms that I will apply to my processed data. 

ML Trials: Attempts to 'try out' different machine learning algorithms and libraries. Usually these are simply notebooks created through tutorials or similar.
